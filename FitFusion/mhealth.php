                <!-- Tip 1 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Start Your Day with Gratitude</h3>
                    <p>Each morning, write down three things you're grateful for. This simple practice can shift your mindset and
improve your mood throughout the day.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 2 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Take Regular Breaks</h3>
                    <p>Step away from your work every hour. Take a 5-minute walk, stretch, or just breathe. Your mind needs rest to
stay focused and productive.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 3 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Practice Deep Breathing</h3>
                    <p>When you feel stressed, try this: Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 4. Repeat 3-5 times. It helps
calm your nervous system instantly.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 4 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Limit Social Media</h3>
                    <p>Set specific times to check social media instead of scrolling all day. Too much screen time can increase anxiety
and affect your sleep quality.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 5 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Connect with Others</h3>
                    <p>Reach out to a friend or family member regularly. Even a short conversation can boost your mood and remind
you that you're not alone.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 6 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Get Regular Check-ups</h3>
                    <p>Visit your doctor for annual physical exams and health screenings. Prevention and early detection are key to staying healthy long-term.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 7 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Set Healthy Boundaries</h3>
                    <p>It's okay to say no. Protect your time and energy by setting clear boundaries with work, relationships, and
commitments.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 8 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Get Quality Sleep</h3>
                    <p>Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Create a bedtime routine: dim lights, no screens 30 minutes before bed,
and keep your room cool.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 9 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Move Your Body</h3>
                    <p>Exercise releases endorphins that improve your mood. You don't need intense workouts—a 20-minute walk
can make a big difference.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 10 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Keep a Journal</h3>
                    <p>Write down your thoughts and feelings. Journaling helps you process emotions, understand patterns, and gain
clarity on what's bothering you.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Tip 11 -->
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Seek Help When Needed</h3>
                    <p>Don't hesitate to talk to a professional if you're struggling. Mental health is just as important as physical health,
and asking for help is a sign of strength.</p>
